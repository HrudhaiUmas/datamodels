IBM Db2 is a **SQL relational database management system** and the official website can be found at [Db2](https://www.ibm.com/products/db2). IBM Db2 is a [commercial database management system](https://www.navisite.com/blog/open-source-vs-commercial-database-systems/) created for commercial uses only, comes at a price, and can only be viewed or modified by authorized users. IBM Db2 **also** supports multiple data models, such as the [object-relational mode](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2-for-zos/11?topic=programs-db2-object-relational-extensions), [XML (hierarchical) model](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=purexml-overview), and [graph model](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=deployments-db2-graph). It supports the cloud hosting model with its [IBM cloud service](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/db2-on-cloud) for a scalable, secure platform, [client/servers](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/10.1.0?topic=SSEPGG_10.1.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.qb.client.doc/doc/c0022616.htm), local hosting models with its ability to be installed and [run locally on a userâ€™s desktop](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/VXK0EBNP), and lastly, [embedded](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/VXK0EBNP). To access Db2 in java, IBM has a [Java database connectivity driver](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8411844/what-is-the-db2-jdbc-driver-or-where-can-i-get-it-from), enabling it to connect to the Db2 database and allowing the execution of SQL queries. The driver can be installed from the [IBM website](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/db2-jdbc-driver-versions-and-downloads).
