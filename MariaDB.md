MariaDB is primarily a relational database management system but also supports [column data models](https://mariadb.com/database-topics/analytics/) and [hierarchical (XML) models](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/understanding-the-hierarchical-database-model/). MariaDB supports [client/server](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/securing-connections-for-client-and-server/), [Cloud](https://www.cloudclusters.io/cloud/mariadb/), and [local](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/connecting-to-mariadb/), but not the embedded hosting model. To connect MariaDB to java, one must use a JDBC driver to connect. There are two ways to connect MariaDB to java. First way is to use a driver manager and the second way is using a pool to connect: [Java and MariaDB](https://hevodata.com/learn/mariadb-java/#s2).
