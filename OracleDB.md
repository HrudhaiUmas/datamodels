Oracle is a relational database management system which the official website can be found here: [OracleDB Website](https://www.oracle.com/database/). Oracle is a [commercial RDBMS](https://www.navisite.com/blog/open-source-vs-commercial-database-systems/) meaning that it is created for commercial uses only, comes at a price, and can only be viewed or modified by authorized users. While primarily an RDBMS, Oracle is multi-model and supports other data models such as [object-relational](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/adobj/key-features-object-relational-model.html), [XML](https://www.oracle.com/a/tech/docs/technical-resources/technicalreport-xdb19c-21c-autonomous.pdf) (hierarchical), and [graph models](https://www.oracle.com/database/graph/). Oracle supports all the hosting models talked about such as [client/server](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/A57673_01/DOC/server/doc/SCN73/ch20.htm), [cloud](https://www.oracle.com/assets/ocloud-hosting-delivery-policies-3089853.pdf), [local](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E24902_01/doc.91/e18843/inst_local_db.htm#EOIWD118) and [embedded] (https://www.oracle.com/topics/technologies/embedded/oracle-embedded-technology.html). To connect Oracle RDBMS to Java, one must download the JDBC driver library for the Oracle database, register to the Oracle JDBC driver, and establish a connection to the [Oracle database](https://www.codejava.net/java-se/jdbc/connect-to-oracle-database-via-jdbc).
