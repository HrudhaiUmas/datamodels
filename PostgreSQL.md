PostgreSQL is a relational database management system and the official website can be found at [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). PostgreSQL is an [open-source RDBMS](https://www.navisite.com/blog/open-source-vs-commercial-database-systems/) which means that it is available at no cost, and many people can view, share and modify the code as a community. PostgreSQL is primarily a relational database management system but also support [key-value](https://arctype.com/blog/postgresql-key-value-store/), [document](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/postgresql-document-database), and [object-relational models](https://arctype.com/blog/postgres-ordbms-explainer/). In terms of the hosting model, PostgreSQL supports client/server (which can be seen in PostgreSQL’s chapter [52.2 document](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/connect-estab.html)), multi-cloud ([Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/sql/postgresql) and [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/), and [MS Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/postgresql/?&ef_id=Cj0KCQjwz6ShBhCMARIsAH9A0qVxVr1GJF7WbAR-KX4g7Uu-A2k4eW5W_BQmUtyhm24fTmMNFaJic_0aAuVKEALw_wcB:G:s&OCID=AIDcmm5edswduu_SEM_Cj0KCQjwz6ShBhCMARIsAH9A0qVxVr1GJF7WbAR-KX4g7Uu-A2k4eW5W_BQmUtyhm24fTmMNFaJic_0aAuVKEALw_wcB:G:s&gclid=Cj0KCQjwz6ShBhCMARIsAH9A0qVxVr1GJF7WbAR-KX4g7Uu-A2k4eW5W_BQmUtyhm24fTmMNFaJic_0aAuVKEALw_wcB)), local(can be downloaded from PostgreSQL's website) [locally installed](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3655953/postgres-everywhere.html ) on one's machine which can be downloaded on the database’s website and can be embedded within a device or app. Lastly, Java can access PostgreSQL by implementing the Java JDBC driver. However, on their website, it is said that many “clients are based on the C-language library libpq,” but it can also be done by other independent implementations such as in [Java](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ecpg.html).
